# CCPP-chpl

CCPP-chpl is a wrapper for the Chapel language over the `ccpp-physics` Fortran library made by NCAR. The repository is a Mason project. 

## Compiling
The `ccpp-physics` library must be compiled prior to using the library. To compile it,
```sh
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```
The `ccpp-physics` is provided as a submodule. Make sure to clone recursively.

## Code Generation
The Chapel functions are generated by parsing the meta files provided inside the `ccpp-physics` library. The code can be found under the `codegen` folder. You do not need to run it, the functions have already been generated. The logic behind the parsing can be found in the README in the `codegen` directory.
